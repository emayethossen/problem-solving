### In the repo I solved these problem....

1. Task: Array Filtering and Mapping
Create an array of objects, each representing a person with properties like name, age, and gender. Write a function to filter out all females and then map the remaining people to an array of names. Print the final result.

2. Task: Function Composition
Write three functions: one to square a number, one to double a number, and one to add 5 to a number. Compose these functions to create a new function that squares a number, doubles the result, and then adds 5.

3. Task: Leap Year Checker
